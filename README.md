*Introduction to Algorithms* 4th edition code snippets

This is like the learning notes I've written down while I was reading *Introduction to Algorithms* 4th edition. Most of the codes in this repository is consistent with the pseudocode in the book, with some appropriate modifications perhaps. This repository will be continuously updating until I finish. Hopefully I will understand the key point of every basic algorithm in computer science, knowing how to analyze and design an approachable algorithm for the problems I meet.
